## P﻿roblem summary

The task is to create a generic server that implements the TCP Echo Service from RFC 862. The server should accept TCP connections and be capable of handling at least five simultaneous clients. Its main functionality is to receive data from clients and send it back unmodified. The server must handle binary data without altering it. Once a client finishes sending data and closes it's sending side, the server should close the corresponding socket after receiving and echoing all the data. This behavior aligns with the requirements specified in the TCP Echo Service definition.
